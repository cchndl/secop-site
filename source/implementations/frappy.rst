Workflow for SECNodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need at most three steps to a working SECNode:

1. Your driver implementation:
    Using the provided base-classes, you overwrite the functions that you need to customize to make your SECoP modules.
    Before you implement something yourself, have a look at the drivers that are already in the repository.
    Maybe the work was already done for you.

2. A configuration file for the server:
    To compose your modules together as parts of a SECNode, you write a simple configuration file.
    List all the modules you want to be part of the SECNode and fill in the required parameters and properties.

3. running the server
    Start the frappy-server and supply your configuration.

For a more detailed breakdown of the process while building an example, have a look at e.g. `this tutorial <https://forge.frm2.tum.de/public/doc/frappy/html/tutorial_t_control.html>`_.
